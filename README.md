Python + Streamlit for interface

OpenAI API for LLM interactions

### Optionally: 
SQLite for storing wellness history

### Prompt Engine Modules:

add_health_log(prompt)

suggest_wellness_activity(mood_input)

motivate_user(current_mood, energy_level)

### Progressive Prompt Design:

#### Intermediate: 
“Suggest a wellness plan for a tired and anxious day.”

#### Advanced: 
“I had a terrible sleep and I’m low on energy. What self-care should I do without screens?”

# 4. Evaluation and Feedback Collection
## Prompt:

Feedback Collection Prompts:

“How helpful were today’s suggestions?”

“Did this make your day feel more manageable?”

### Feedback Summary:

#### Liked: 
Non-judgmental tone, variety of suggestions

#### Wanted: 
Integration with smartwatch, sleep tracking

# 5. Prototype/System Outline
## Backend:

Python + OpenAI API prompt management

SQLite file for logging mood and activities

## Frontend:

Streamlit dashboard: Mood slider, activity log, suggested actions

Minimal CLI for quick check-ins

### Sample Interaction:

“Hey! I see you rated your mood a 5/10 today. Let’s do a 2-min breathing exercise and a short gratitude note. How about: What’s one thing you’re proud of today? ”

# 6. User Testing Results and Improvement Plan
## User Testing:

10 participants used the wellness assistant for 7 days

Most used features: quick breathing breaks, motivation check-ins

### Results:

75% reported “improved awareness of emotional state”

60% adopted at least one new wellness habit

## Next Steps:

Add mood tracking graph

Support for audio mindfulness sessions

Gamify healthy habit streaks




# Result: 
The Prompt is executed successfully
